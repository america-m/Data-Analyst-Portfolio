**Case Study:**

Millennium Health

Doctor Johnson and Doctor Diaz recently decided that their practice needs a modern information system to support its business and health information management needs. The new system would replace a mix of paper-based and legacy systems. Dr. Johnson asked you to design an information system that could support the clinic’s current operations and future growth.
In your first meeting, Dr. Johnson provided an overview of the clinic’s business processes and staff members. He described the staff as follows:

Sheila Logan, office manager.

Support staff reporting to Sheila are:

Fred Brown -- human resources and employee benefits.

Ricky Flemming reports directly to Fred and works with payroll, tax reporting, and profit distribution among the associates.

Aisha Fox is responsible for the maintenance of patient medical records.

Zane Ricardo handles accounts receivables.

Deb Baldwin is the insurance billing specialist.

Min-ji Park is responsible for managing appointments. Her duties include reminder calls to patients and preparing daily appointment lists.

Clare Kline is concerned primarily with ordering and organizing office and medical supplies.

After studying this information, you start to prepare for your next meeting with Dr. Johnson.

**Methodology Utilized**

We are planning to use agile methodology, specifically Scrum. Compared to other methodologies Agile Scrum allows for changes and adjustments throughout the project. It is best practiced when you have a high level of uncertainty in your project. It breaks the project into small and manageable sprints. 

There are some cons of agile scrum methodology. For example, if your company is limited in their resources it might not be the best practice because scrum requires active participation from team members. It also prioritizes working software over comprehensive documentation.  Since Millenium Health needs their business support system running at a faster rate the focus on the software is essential. However, you have to lead by example in your company to make your business expand. 

Project Lifecycle:

Initiation: Starting the project by broadly defining it.
Planning: Setting up a thorough project plan, including its objectives or scope, timeline, and resources.
Execution: Putting the project plan into action.
Closedown: Concluding the project plan, getting the customer's approval, and providing project resources.

Benefits of Project Management:

Improved efficiency because processes are streamlined through project management, ensuring that activities or tasks are done quickly and effectively.
Better communication results from project management's encouragement of open and transparent communication between teams and clients, ensuring that everyone is in agreement.
There is cost control since effective budgeting and tracking ensures the project stays on budget, avoiding cost overruns.
Project management strategies like scheduling make sure the project concludes on time.
Customer satisfaction rises due to meeting project goals, quality requirements, and deadlines.
Post-project reviews will help determine areas for improvement, and future initiatives will allow for continuous improvement.

We will use project management through the chart we already created to organize tasks needed to be completed throughout the project. We have also used project management to establish the role of everyone at Millennium Health to identify the needs of the company. We have also used it to establish strong communication among each other and project management strategies we will use in the future. 

Such as, post project reviews to help determine areas that need improvement, and initiatives that will allow for future improvement. We will also ensure customer satisfaction by meeting goals, requirements, and deadlines that are a part of project management.
